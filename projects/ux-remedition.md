title: UX Remediation Project
description: >-
  For this project, customer had identified their initial Employee Centre was
  receiving poor feedback from users and needed an upgrade. 


  Upon meeting the customer we performed a number of workshops and an analysis on the existing Employee Center and Taxonomy, identifying areas for improvement with UX, navigation, performance and maintainability throughout future upgrades. 


  Customer portal was redesigned with : 

  - New Branding

  - Using the new left side navigation

  - CSS adjustments to enhance portal look and feel

  - Redesigned Taxonomy for an easier and better user journey

  - Updated pages for a better experience for users reviewing their requests

  - Removal of partner based custom widgets and customization to improve upgradeability
