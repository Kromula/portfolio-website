## Project Overview

Customer had received negative feedback on their existing portal having conducted and internal review, and felt themselves the portal looked dated. After some initial discussions and workshops,  
a review and analysis was performed to understand the current situation and where enhancements could be made.  

## Challenge

 - Existing Portal was built in Employee Center but using a Service Portal style layout.  
 - Portal had significant UX issues with text and images.  
 - Portal had significant widget alignment and CSS issues.  
 - Taxonomy was large and cumbersome, with little connected content.  
 - Landing page had significant partner widget customisations.  


## Solution

Analysis was performed on the portal and taxonomy. Issues with the existing portal were identified and remediation steps outlined.  
An initial prototype was built, which was then refined throguh an iterative design approach.  
Review was performed on existing taxonomy, and provided a report indicating the issues with the Taxonomy and a suggested new approach.  
Customer then led internal workshops to draft a new Taxonomy design which was much simpler and resultd in an approved user experience.  

## Key Features

- Redesigned modern layout. 
- Implemented new ServiceNow features like updated My Requests, left side navigation and modern ticket layout.  
- Removed REQ from portal in a configurable, not customised, method.  
- Introduced notifications to portal.
- Additions of CSS styling for a unique experience tailored to the customers branding.
